# To Do List

This to do app is built in Angular 6, using Firebase as the database. Enter any valid email and a password greater than 6 characters to get access (there may be a short delay of a few seconds). All tasks will be associated with this email address, so you can log in at your convenience.

## Current features

* User Registration, login and logout
* View, add, update and delete tasks
* Mark tasks as complete / incomplete

## Future improvements

* Loading icons
* Improve error handling and test coverage
* Ability to update the names of the tasks
* Ability to login via social media / other platforms

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
